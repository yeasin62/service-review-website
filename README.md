## Project Description
1. Simple Review Website
2. Login and Registration system
3. Firebase Integration
4. JWT token authentication
5. Light box integrate (image)
6. Private Route
7. Public Route
8. Conditional review system
9. Live link: 




### Bonus Requirements

3. Add a **spinner** on the services page, and the login and register page. If data is loading, a spinner will be displayed.

6. In the "My reviews" page, clicking the **edit review** button/icon shows that review in a modal/in a new route and lets the user update it.
7.  **Simple challenge** In the service details page, **sort the reviews in a descending order** by inserting time(you have to keep the inserting time when you add a review, you can do it with the Date object, or you can explore MongoDB documentation). You will have to implement this code on the server side.

### Additional information:
1. You can use vanilla CSS, any CSS library, framework, or component library you want.
4. If possible, try another component library other than daisyUI
5. If needed, you can mix a CSS framework with a component library
6. You may use `react hook form`, basic html form or any library for authentication
7. Store JWT token in http only cookie (alternatively, feel free to store it in the Local storage for this assignment)
9. Try to host your site on Firebase (Netlify host will need extra configuration)
10. Try to host the server on Vercel
### What to submit 
1. Your client-side code GitHub repository
2. Your server-side code GitHub repository
3. Your live website link
